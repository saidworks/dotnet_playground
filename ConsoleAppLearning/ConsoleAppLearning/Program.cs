     * Inventory management system

        To complete this challenge, you will need to create a console application where 
        users can manage product stock. 
        
        Users should be able to add new products, update stock, and remove products.

        Some key features include:

        - Add new products with name, price, and stock quantity.

        - Update stock when products are sold or restocked.

        - View all products and their stock levels.

        - Remove products from inventory.
